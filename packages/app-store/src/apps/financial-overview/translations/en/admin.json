    "description": "**Financial Overview** adds a dedicated dashboard tab with clear, easy-to-understand financial metrics, giving you a quick snapshot of your revenue, payments, and overall performance at a glance.\n\nIn addition to your financial totals, it helps you understand how customers move through your booking process — showing how many people complete a booking and where others may drop off before finishing.
